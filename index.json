Given the expertise from IJCAI-PRICAI20 attendees, we see this an excellent opportunity for networking researchers to interact with ML/AI community to foster new knowledges and advance the state of art. We expect to have papers contributed by researchers and practitioners, as well as invited talks by distinguished experts. In particular, we will organize a competition (NetAML Competition, sponsored by Intel Corp., pending approvals) at IJCAI- PRICAI20 on machine learning based traffic analytics before the deadline of the workshop submission, and encourage participants of the competition to submit papers to and present their results at the NETAML workshop. We hope this workshop will catalyze the research and development of novel methods for network traffic analytics with rich datasets, vigorous discussions, new directions and fruitful collaborations.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://netaml.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"The NETAML 2020 workshop aims to provide a venue for the community to present and discuss the latest advances in traffic analysis, with an emphasis on novel machine learning based approaches.

In this year’s challenge, a collection of 1,199,139 flows in three different datasets are given including detailed flow features and labels. We also provide simple APIs and baseline machine learning models to demonstrate the usage of the datasets and evaluation metrics. There are 7 tracks for specific analytics objectives.\nThis challenge is organized by the Laboratory of Advanced Computer Architecture and Network Systems (ACANETS) at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and sponsored by Intel Corporation.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"45798c230cc3b604900d6e78325179d9","permalink":"https://netaml.github.io/challenge/netml/overview/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/challenge/netml/overview/","section":"challenge","summary":"Challenge Overview Recent progress in AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning has demonstrated tremendous success in many application domains such as games and computer vision.
